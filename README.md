# iA Coding Challenge

### My Setup:

The language I used for this challenge was **Python**. I created my repository through GitHub, cloned the repository in Sourcetree using SSH, and opened the repository for editing in Visual Studio Code.

### How to Run:
1. The code can be locally downloaded from GitHub. To download the code from GitHub, navigate to the repository page and click the green "Code" button. 
2. You can use any editor with Python capabilities in order to open and run the code. No dependencies are used.
3. From the editor terminal, you can use `python ia_coding_challenge.py` or `python3 ia_coding_challenge.py` to run the code. Or, if your editor has a "Run Python File" button, that can be used as well.

### Assumptions:
1. Orders and medications lists are written in the proper format. For example, order is [OrderID]:[Medication Name] and medication is [Medication Name]:[Handling Instruction Codes].
2. Handling instruction codes and instructions are properly represented by values 0, 1, 2, and 3. Handling instructions in the medications list are also assumed to be within the values 0, 1, 2, and 3.
